|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Creating a New Game Session      | As an admin, I want to create a new game session so I can configure the trivia experience for players.  | The system should allow the admin to create a new session and generate a unique game code to share with players.                                                    |
| FR002          | Game Settings Configuration      | As an admin, I want to set the number of questions, category, difficulty, type, and time per question.  | The system should provide a form where the admin selects configuration options. These settings should dynamically build the Open Trivia DB API request.            |
| FR003          | Fetching Trivia Questions        | As a system, I want to fetch trivia questions using the admin’s settings so each game session is unique.| The system should construct a valid API URL based on admin settings and fetch questions from Open Trivia DB before the game starts.                                |
| FR004          | Joining a Game Session           | As a player, I want to join a game session using a code so I can participate in the trivia game.        | Players should be able to input a valid game code and be added to the session if the room has not started and is under the 10-player limit.                        |
| FR005          | Lobby and Player List            | As a player, I want to see who else is in the lobby before the game starts so I know who I’m playing with.| The system should show a list of all connected players in real time while waiting in the lobby.                                                                     |
| FR006          | Starting the Game                | As an admin, I want to start the game when everyone is ready.                                           | Once started, the game should broadcast the first question to all connected players and disable new joins.                                                          |
| FR007          | Displaying Trivia Questions      | As a player, I want to see a question and multiple-choice answers clearly on my screen.                 | Each question should be displayed with shuffled options. Players should be able to click to select an answer.                                                       |
| FR008          | Timed Questions                  | As a player, I want to have a limited time to answer each question.                                     | The question should progress only when the admin clicks on the provided "Next Question" button.                                                      |
| FR009          | Real-Time Scoring                | As a system, I want to score players based on how fast they answer correctly.                           | Players should receive points proportional to the time remaining when they submit a correct answer. Incorrect answers receive zero.                                |
| FR010          | Leaderboard Display              | As a player, I want to see my score and rank after each round so I can track my performance.            | The system should display a live leaderboard after every question or round, showing current scores of all players.                                                  |
| FR011          | Ending the Game                  | As a player, I want to see final scores at the end of the game.                                         | After the last round, the game should show the final rankings and offer a button to restart or exit the session.                                                   |
| FR012          | Responsive UI Design             | As a user, I want the UI to look clean and work well on any screen size.                               | The frontend should use React + TailwindCSS with responsive design, subtle animations, and minimalistic gradients.                                                  |
| FR013          | Preventing Late Joins            | As a system, I want to lock the game once it starts.                                                    | After the game begins, the join code should no longer allow new players to enter the session.                                                                      |
| FR014          | Handling Invalid Game Codes      | As a player, I want clear feedback if I enter a bad game code.                                          | The system should display a helpful error message if the game code does not exist or has expired.                                                                   |
| FR015          | Managing Question Rounds         | As an admin, I want to set the number of rounds to control game length.                                | The system should repeat the question flow for the configured number of rounds, ending with a final score display.                                                  |
